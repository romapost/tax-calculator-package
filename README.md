- [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)
- [ApprovalTests.PHP](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.php)
- [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)
- [Easy Coding Standard (ECS)](https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard) 
- [PHP CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki)

## Folders

- `src` - contains the two classes:
- `tests` - contains the tests
- `Fixture`
  - `texttest_fixture.php` used by the approval test, or can be run from the command line

## Testing

PHPUnit is pre-configured to run tests. PHPUnit can be run using a composer script. To run the unit tests, from the
 root of the PHP project run:

```shell script
composer test
```

On Windows a batch file has been created, similar to an alias on Linux/Mac (e.g. `alias pu="composer test"`), the same
 PHPUnit `composer test` can be run:

```shell script
pu
```

### Tests with Coverage Report

To run all test and generate a html coverage report run:

```shell script
composer test-coverage
```

The test-coverage report will be created in /builds, it is best viewed by opening **index.html** in your browser.

## Code Standard

Easy Coding Standard (ECS) is used to check for style and code standards, **PSR-12** is used. 
### Check Code

To check code, but not fix errors:

```shell script
composer check-cs
``` 

On Windows a batch file has been created, similar to an alias on Linux/Mac (e.g. `alias cc="composer check-cs"`), the
 same PHPUnit `composer check-cs` can be run:

```shell script
cc
```

### Fix Code

There are may code fixes automatically provided by ECS, if advised to run --fix, the following script can be run:

```shell script
composer fix-cs
```

On Windows a batch file has been created, similar to an alias on Linux/Mac (e.g. `alias fc="composer fix-cs"`), the same
 PHPUnit `composer fix-cs` can be run:

```shell script
fc
```

## Static Analysis

PHPStan is used to run static analysis checks:

```shell script
composer phpstan
```

On Windows a batch file has been created, similar to an alias on Linux/Mac (e.g. `alias ps="composer phpstan"`), the
 same PHPUnit `composer phpstan` can be run:

```shell script
ps
```

**Happy coding**!
